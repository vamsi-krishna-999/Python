AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm, 
meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. AES is 
widely used and considered one of the most secure encryption algorithms 
available today. The "256-bit" part refers to the key size, which determines 
the complexity of the encryption. In AES-256, the key size is 256 bits.


How AES works:
==============
Key Expansion: 
--------------     
The original key undergoes a key expansion algorithm 
to generate a series of round keys, which are used in 
the subsequent encryption and decryption rounds.

Initial Round: 
--------------
The plaintext is XORed with the first round key.


Rounds: 
-------
AES operates through a series of rounds (10, 12, or 14 rounds 
depending on the key size - 128, 192, or 256 bits respectively). 
Each round consists of several transformations such as 
substitution, permutation, and mixing of the data.

Final Round: 
------------

The final round is slightly different from the previous ones, 
it lacks the "MixColumns" transformation step.

Output: 
--------
The result after the final round is the ciphertext (encrypted data).
