Django Project Structure:
A Django project typically consists of multiple apps, each serving a specific functionality within the project. Here's the general structure of a Django project:

project_name/
│
├── project_name/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
│
├── app1/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
│
├── app2/
│   ├── ...
│
└── manage.py
project_name/: The root directory of your Django project.

project_name/: This inner directory is the Python package for your project.
__init__.py: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.

settings.py: Configuration settings for your Django project, including database configuration, static files, middleware, etc.

urls.py: URL declarations for the entire project, mapping URLs to views.

wsgi.py: WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) entry-point for production deployment.

app1/, app2/, ...: Individual Django apps within the project.
Each app follows its own structure, which includes files like models.py, views.py, urls.py, etc.

manage.py: A command-line utility for interacting with your Django project. It allows you to run development server, create database migrations, run tests, etc.
