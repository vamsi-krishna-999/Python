Highlights of Django:
Rapid development: Django provides built-in features and conventions that streamline development, such as automatic admin interfaces, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and template system.
Security: Django helps developers build secure web applications by providing built-in protections against common security threats, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
Scalability: Django is designed to scale easily, allowing developers to build applications that can handle high traffic and large amounts of data.
Community and ecosystem: Django has a large and active community of developers and contributors who provide support, documentation, and a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and packages.
Versatility: Django can be used to build a wide range of web applications, from simple blogs and content management systems to complex enterprise-level applications.
Author of Django:
Django was originally developed by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison while working at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas, USA. It was released as an open-source project in July 2005.

Origin of Django Name:
The name "Django" is derived from the jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. It reflects the emphasis on fast-paced development and improvisation that the framework encourages.
